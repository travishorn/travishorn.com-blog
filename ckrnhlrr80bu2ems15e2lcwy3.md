This post is part of a project to move my old reference material to my blog. Before 2012, when I accessed the same pieces of code or general information multiple times, I would write a quick HTML page for my own reference and put it on a personal site. Later, I published these pages online. Some of the pages still get used and now I want to make them available on my blog.

1. Make sure you are on the **Home tab**

1. Click **Change Styles**

1. Under **Style Set**, click **Word 2003**

1. Click **Change Styles**

1. Click **Set as Default**
