This post is part of a project to move my old reference material to my blog. Before 2012, when I accessed the same pieces of code or general information multiple times, I would write a quick HTML page for my own reference and put it on a personal site. Later, I published these pages online. Some of the pages still get used and now I want to make them available on my blog.

Back in 2010, I wanted to have a hard-copy version of the SQLite official documentation. I created a PDF document for this. The major benefit to this document is that it can be used offline. You can throw it on a flash drive or save it to a server machine that has limited Internet connectivity.

While the vast majority of the content is still relevant, be warned that I created this document in August of 2010. Some information may be outdated.
