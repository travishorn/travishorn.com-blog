This post is part of a project to move my old reference material to my blog. Before 2012, when I accessed the same pieces of code or general information multiple times, I would write a quick HTML page for my own reference and put it on a personal site. Later, I published these pages online. Some of the pages still get used and now I want to make them available on my blog.

### Check Cables

First, make sure all cables are attached; especially the network cable from the modem. The end looks like a phone connector but wider.

Turn on PC and open your web browser (Examples: Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox). If there’s no connection, try:

### Reset Connection on PC

You may need to reset your network connection settings…

1. Click **Start** > **Settings** > **Network Connections**

1. Right-Click **Local Area Connection**

1. Click **Repair**

1. Wait for repair to complete

1. Open your browser to test it

If there’s still no connection, try:

### Reset Modem

You may need to reset the modem…

1. Unplug the power cable from the back of the modem

1. Wait 20–30 seconds

1. Plug power cable back in

1. Wait for a minute or so until the modem is ready

1. Open your browser to test it

If there’s still no connection you could try to **Reset the Connection on the PC** again after this step.
